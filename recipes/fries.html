        <ol>
            <li>1 pound russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ol>
       <h2>Directions</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Cut each potato lengthwise into 3/8-inch-thick slices, then slice sections into 3/8-inch-wide sticks.
        </p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Place potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Let soak to release excess starches, about 5 minutes; drain.
        </p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Pour boiling water over the potatoes until they're covered by a few inches. Let sit for 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Drain potatoes and transfer onto some paper towels. Blot off excess water and let cool completely, at least 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Place cooled potatoes in a mixing bowl. Drizzle with oil and season with cayenne; toss to coat.</p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        <li>Step 7</li>
        <p>Stack potatoes in a double layer in the fryer basket. Cook for 15 minutes. Slide basket out and toss fries. 
            Continue frying until golden brown, about 10 minutes more.
        </p>
        <li>Step 8</li>
        <p>Toss fries with salt in a mixing bowl. Serve immediately.</p>
